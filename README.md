# Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 3

In this project user conversion data from a website is analyzed to provide statistical conclusions for an AB Test. Result will indicate whether the new page produces more conversions than the current, and whether it makes sense to implement.

Hypothesis testing and regression are both used as different methods for this analysis, and to provide multiple points of comparison.
